It uses Particle's dev kit, currently set up for the [Particle Photon](https://store.particle.io/collections/photon), the WiFi version. 

#### Status

This project is still in Beta and I will update this page as we go along.
If you have any questions about the code or the componenets, email me at noam@cca.edu.

An [Electron](https://store.particle.io/collections/electron) version coming soon. 

## Components
* Particle Photon
* **A GPS Breakout** - [Adafruit Ultimate GPS V3](https://www.adafruit.com/product/746)
* **A Compass Breakout** - [LSM303DLHC](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1120)
* **Heating Pads** - I'm using [Adafruit's](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1481)
* An **External Active GPS Antenna** (and the correct connectors + adaptors for it) - you can buy Adafruit's or find something on eBay / Amazon
* A **power source for the Photon** - either a 3.7v Lipo Battery, or a regular 5V USB Bank. 
* A **7-12V High Capacity, High Drain battery pack** â€“ to run the heating circuits (not a regular 9V) - See [Powering this Project] below.

  You can swap some of these components with others, but it might require a library or code tweak.
  You can also make your own heating pads or swap the output with something like LEDs or Vibration motors.

## Powering this Project
  You'll need at least 7000mAh to get the heating pads to really heat up. The heating pad I'm using are about 11cm in width. Check out the data sheet with the V/Ah tables [here](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/Ultra+Heating+Fabric.pdf).
  
  To get the Voltage and Amperage needed, I recommend using something like [this](http://a.co/99Ji5B1) or A couple of these [18650 Batteries](http://a.co/b3cm1pK)

  :boom::boom::boom:  **Make sure you buy 18650 batteries with circuit protection! If they don't say they have it, they don't.  
  Unprotected batteries of that sort have the potential to burst into fire or explode!**
  
For the Particle - use a separate power supply (like any USB 5V phone battery), or connect a 3.3V power source to the VIN pin.

You can also create a voltage regulator circuit to split the power supply to a nice clean 3.3v for the Photon, but make sure to test it before, and use a proper heatsink. This project gets pretty hot already! 

## Setup
These instructions assume you have a basic knowledge of soldering, programming and a familiarity with the Particle IDE environment. If you're just beginning with Particle, I recommend you check out the [Getting Started guide](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/start/photon/), and build a few basic circuit first.
If you run into any issue or any question - feel free to email me at noam@cca.edu. 

### Create the circuit
Either on a breadboard, or on a protoboard. If you're brave - sew the components onto a piece of fabric using conductive thread.
### Power the Particle
Make sure the particle device is powered separately (using the USB connector or the vin pin) than the heat pads. The Heatpads need to be powered by the big power supply, but the Particle can only take 5V through the USB, or 3.3v through the VIN pin. 
Their GNDs need to be connected for switching the heatapd MOSFETs on and off. 
### Upload the code
Either use the Particle Dev IDE with the entire file set from this github repository, or copy the contents of [src/warm.ino] to the [particle online IDE](https://build.particle.io/), and import the libraries specified below under [libraries](#libraries).
### Power the heatpads 
Make sure you plug in the power supply for the heatpads last. The project boots up with heat on, so when you plug in the batteries, one of the heatpads should start heating up (there's a default destination programmed). 
**Test it** - Check carefully with your fingers that:
* Only one heatpad is heating up
* That the batteries are not heating up
* That the MOSFETS are not heating up.

If any of the above is happening, unplug the batteries and check for shortcircuits or inverted components.

There's also a Particle Function you can use to turn the power to the heating circuit off, called *toggleHeat*. Send a zero, or any other character to it to turn the heaters off temporarily.  

## Operation
The project is meant to be worn. Attach the heating pads to the inside of a shirt, a vest or a jacket, and wire them to the circuit so the pins align to the diagram below:

The diagram shows the allotment of bearing angles to heating pads. The Cardinal Directions (N/E/S/W) are not true magnetic directions, but based on the direction of the individual. "North" is pointing to the front.

### Particle Functions
Warm & Fuzzies is controlled using the functions and variables on [Particle Dashboard](https://console.particle.io/devices). Find the right device under your account while the particle is turned on and connected to see the variables and functions:
![Dashboard](ParticleDashboard.png)

#### ***Cloud Variables***
* **Compass** - Shows you the compass heading in degrees. The compass heading is not 100% accurate (moves between 80-90% accuracy). If you know a solution to get a better compass reading (and I've tried a lot of different compasses breakouts), email me. 
* **Latitude** & **Longitude** - These show the GPS information in Lon and Lat, recieved from the GPS. If they show 0, it means the GPS hasn't found the satelites yet. 
* **Location**  - Shows your GPS Location in Decimal Degrees (easier to work in, especially on Google Maps). 
* **heater** - Shows the active heater from the heater array. 
* **Bearing** The compass angle between you and the target location, in degrees.
* **Cardinal** - Shows the cardinal direction between you and the target location. Always shows it with 2 letters, so NNE for example will still show as NE. 
* **IsHeatOn** - Tells you if the heating circuits are toggled. 

To update the variables value, click the little `GET` button. 

#### *** Cloud Functions***
All functions will return 0 or 1. To see the values of those who return a meaningful values, see the Variables above. 

To trigger most of these, send any character on them (other than heat & setTarget which expect specific values).

* **getGPS** - Gets the current GPS location. 
* **setTarget** - Sets the destination target for Warm & Fuzzies. Put in your home location, or any other place of importance using decimal degrees. 
* **heat** - wanted to turn on and off a heatpad manually? send the heatpad number (2-6) or name (A0, A1, A2) to turn it on. Disconnect the GPS if you want to use this, or the GPS will turn another one based on the angle between you and destination. 
* **toggleHeat** - Turns off the heating pads temporarily when sent anything but 0. 1 will turn it back on. 
* **AntennaStat** - Shows the state of the GPS's Antenna (right here on the function). Returns 1, 2, or 3. Based on NMEA codes which is used by the [GPS from adafruit](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/downloads/pdf/adafruit-ultimate-gps.pdf): 1 means antenna short or problem, 2 means internal (not enough to get a signal indoors usally) and 3 means external (which if you bought it, should show). 
* **getCompass** - This is done automatically, but if you want to get another compass reading, you can send any value to this variable. 

***TO BEGIN*** There's a built in target destination in the code. To set up your own, input coordinates in the function *SetTarget* on the [Particle Dashboard].
(https://console.particle.io/devices). This will take a location in Lat & Lon, Decimal Degrees (DD). To get lat & lon from google maps, see [this guide](http://www.wikihow.com/Get-Latitude-and-Longitude-from-Google-Maps). 

Warm & Fuzzies will start getting warmer towards the direction of your target. When you move around, so would the warm feeling towards that place, or that person. 

# Code Walkthrough
### Libraries
I have created this project using the [Particle Web IDE](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/build/photon/) and the libraries below. They should all be added automatically with the 'project.properties' file if you use the [Particle Dev IDE desktop software](https://www.particle.io/products/development-tools/particle-desktop-ide), but in case this fails or if you're using the WEB IDE, you will need to add these libraries to your code, using the libraries tab. 

* Adafruit_Sensor (1.0.2)
* [Particle-GPS](https://github.com/porrey/Particle-GPS) (1.0.4) by Daniel Porrey
* [Adafruit_LSM303_U](https://github.com/zomerfeld/Adafruit_LSM303_U) (1.0.8) by Adafruit's Kevin Townsend (ported by yours truly)  
<br>

The code is fairly well documented with comments inline. There are a few that are worth calling out here and explaining.
If you have any questions, feel free to email me. 

### Code Variables
* `heaters` is an array which stores all of the pins associated with the heating pads. If for whatever reason you need to re-assign pins, first update the list here, then also update the turning on of those pins in the functions `heat` and `heatBearing`.
* `tHeat` - is set to 1 by default, which means that at least one heater will heat up when the project is starting. To stop that from happening automatically, change or toggle it to 0. 
* `coldPin` - An optional pin for an LED that will turn on when all heaters are off. 
* `magxOffset` & `magyOffset` - depending on the type of compass you're using, you might need\able to offset the reading by [calibrating the magnetometer](https://learn.adafruit.com/lsm303-accelerometer-slash-compass-breakout?view=all). Although I still am having some issues with my compass, I haven't found it particularly helpful. 
* `Timer` - Timers are great! They're a good and easy way to call a function every X milliseconds in a non interruptive way. They're built into the [Particle Firmware](https://docs.particle.io/reference/firmware/photon/#software-timers), but there's also an [Arduino Library](http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/SimpleTimer) for them if you need it. 
  * The first timer gets the GPS raw data every 1 ms
  * The second timer (timerCompass) launches the [getCompData](#getCompData) function every 0.5 second to get the compass direction.
  * The third timer (timerWear) launchces the [wearable](#wearable) function every second. 

There are also a lot of variables, specifically around coordinates that hold the same information in different variables type (floats, longs, ints, and strings) - these are used for different aspects of the system, like sending debug messages to the particle cloud logs, or for sharing with other variables. 

## Important Functions
### setup 
Setup (default function, runs at the beginning of the code) calls all the Particle Cloud Cariables & Functions, defines the LED and the heatpad pins, waits, starts the timers and initializes the magnetometer and the GPS.
It also sets up Serial debugging (9600 bps) and holds the default destination (it will revert to it after every restart). If you wanted to change the default destination, do it in the last line of setup: `setTarget("21.422474, 39.826192");`
### loop
the loop function (runs on loop on every particle and arduino device), has a millisecond timer inside (the software timers were too early for it), which waits 8 seconds from bootup time, and then triggers [getGPS] every 10 seconds, to get the processed GPS data. 
### getCompData
Gets the compass data, normalizes it to a heading (0-360 degrees) and saves it into the variable `compassPublic`.
### getComp
Does the same as [getCompData] but also publishes the raw data to Serial, and the heading to Serial and the Particle Cloud log. This one is used less, and mostly for debug. 
### toggleHeat
Associated with the cloud function with the same name, toggles heating on or off.
### heat
This functions recieves a pin (from the cloud function directly, or from other functions such as [heatBearing]. 
It checks if heating is set to on or off (using the `tHeat` variable). If it's set to 0, it doesn't heat anything and returns 0. 
If heating is toggled on:
It verifies the pin (if the recieved command is not a valid pin, it will shut off all heaters and turn the cold LED on), and after the pin is verified, it heats the associated heatpad and turns off all of the others. 

Returns 1 if the function turned a pin on.
### antStat
Checks the status of the Antenna, associated with the cloud function `AntennaStat`.
Returns a different value for each antenna status and publishes it to the Particle Cloud log. 
### getGPS
Parses the raw GPA data (that is already retrieved every ms), converts it from minutes and degrees to decimal degrees, and saves it to global variables: `lat` & `lon`(as floats) and `latPublic` & `lonPublic` (as doubles for publishing to the cloud).
It also saves the location as a string to the cloud variable `location`.

If there is no GPS data, this function will return a 0 and not 1. 
### setTarget
Associated with the cloud function under the same name, this functions accept a string with coordinates in decimal degrees, cleans up the whitespace, splits it to lat & lon, saves them to `targetLat` & `targetLon`, publishes those to the cloud, and triggers [getDirection], [getBearing], and [heatBearing].
### getDirection
This function is not very useful honestly. It calculates the cardinal direction (i.e NE, SE, SW or NW) between the target destination and the current GPS location of Warm & Fuzzies.
## getBearing
getBearing calculates the angle (in degrees) from current location to target destination based on the GPS data.
Formulas and calculation based on this [example](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/29239/calculate-bearing-between-two-decimal-gps-coordinates) (after painful painful conversion to C++).
It saves the angle between the two as a the global variable `bearing`.
## heatBearing
This functions binds it all up!
It calculates the difference between the **bearing** (the angle between us and our destination), and the **compass reading**, and derives what part of the body is facing the destination. It then asks the [heat] function to heat up that area using the compass pin diagram above.

If you've changed the heater pins or the placement of the pads, update this function.

## Caveats and Important notes
### Compass orientation
Compass orientation is difficult and tricky with Arduino. It uses magnetic field detection and can be affected by strong magnetic forces around you, or the angle of the compass board. If any of you finds a good solid way to get 100% accurate compass readings with a breakout board, please let me know or fork this repository.
